# Felony Murder Project
Felony murder investigation 

# Introduction
Every year, many Americans are wrongly convicted of murder due to the obscure law known as the felony murder rule. In 48 states and DC, an individual can be held accountable for a death that occurs during the commission of a crime, regardless of their intent to cause that death. This law has a significant impact on the American justice system, but the picture of who gets charged with felony murder, how often, and why remains unclear due to the missingness of data.

# Goal
Our goal is to use data science and journalism to clarify the understanding of the felony murder rule in America. We aim to determine the number of people incarcerated under the felony murder rule and analyze demographic breakdown, the process of enforcing the rule, and the legal and social reasons for its existence.

# Data Collection
We will gather data from existing datasets, public records requests, and individual-level webscraping. The sources of data include the University of Michigan’s Institute Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), the FBI’s Expanded Homicide Dataset, and prison and jail inmate locators.

# Analysis
Our first priority is determining the number of people incarcerated under the felony murder rule. Then, we will analyze demographic information, the enforcement process, and legal and social reasons for the existence of the rule. We will also explore gendered disparities in the application of the rule and the strategies of prosecutors and other justice system actors. We will link the data to court cases, news articles, and correctional locators based on name and DOC number. Howard University School of Law will assist in analyzing the qualitative data.
